Symptoms may include changes in personality, mood and/or behavior.  Dementia is irreversible when caused by disease or injury, but may be reversible when caused by depression, drugs, alcohol, or chemical imbalances. %%M###Diabetes###Diabetes is an on-going medical condition and without proper management can result in serious medical complications.  Because RCFEs are licensed as non-medical facilities and are not required to employ a licensed medical professional, the consumer should know what is legally allowed within the RCFE setting regarding diabetes care.   RCFEs are allowed to accept or retain a diabetic resident if the resident is able to perform his/her glucose testing with blood or urine specimens and is able to administer his/her own medications (oral or injections), or if the resident has the medication administered by an appropriately skilled professional.  Diabetes is an allowable health condition in an RCFE. %%G###Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Form###A Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Form means the pre-hospital do-not-resuscitate forms developed by the California Emergency Medical Services (EMS)Authority among others.

Also - see POLST. %%G###Delayed Egress###This term refers to a time delay product frequently installed on some doors in an RCFE.  The purpose of a delayed egress device prevents a door being opened for a brief interval - usually 15 to 20 seconds.  This device is useful for preventing elopements of demented residents.  An RCFE must have CCL's permission to have delayed egress devices installed on doors in the facility%%G###Egress Alert Device###An egress alert device is a device which may be worn by a resident or carried on a resident's person which triggers a visual or auditory alarm for caregiving staff when the resident leaves the facility building or grounds. %%G###Exceptions###An exception as it relates to RCFE licensing means a variance from a specific regulation based on the unique need or circumstance of a specific resident or staff person.  Exceptions may only be granted by the licensing agency, and they may not be transferred or applied to any other individual.				
							
Also, under Title 22, Section 87209 - Program Flexibility, a licensee can submit a request for a written exception to retain a resident who has a restricted or prohibited health condition and who would otherwise have to move to a higher level of care.%%FP###Eviction###An eviction is a notice for the resident to move.  The licensee must give 30 days written notice of eviction (60 days written notice if resident has lived at facility for over 1 year) to the resident, or resident's responsible party.  There are only 5 reasons a resident can be evicted from an RCFE:				
			- Nonpayment of the rate for basic services within 10 days of the due date,				
			- Failure of a resident to comply with state or local law after a written notice of the alleged violation has been issued from the appropriate authorities;				
			- Failure of a resident to comply with the written policies of the facility, such policies must be contained in the signed Admissions Agreement,				
			- When the RCFE has changed its purpose (changing from RCFE to independent living for example),				
			- If the resident, after reappraisal, is deemed to no longer be appropriate for the level of care offered by the facility.				
							
			Residents have the right to file a complaint regarding evictions.  Such complaints should be filed with the local Community Care Licensing office. %%G###FBI Clearance###An FBI Clearance means that an individual has no felony or misdemeanor convictions reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The individual may also have been arrested with no criminal conviction, convicted of a minor traffic offense, or adjudicated as a juvenile.   Licensees, employees, volunteers and other non-resident individuals residing in the facility must have a Criminal Record Clearance before having a presence in the facility%%IE###Facility Evaluations###Facility evaluations can occur for several reasons, including:				
			- All RCFEs are subject to unannounced visits at any time by CCL.				
			- CCLD must conduct a facility evaluation at least once every 5 years.				
			- If a facility is on probation or on a compliance plan,  CCL will conduct more frequent visits during the probationary period.				
			- To verify that a person who has been ordered out of an RCFE is no longer at the facility.				
			- When the facility requires an annual visit as a condition of receiving federal financial participation.				
Facility Evaluations include annual, annual random, case management, pre-licensing and post-licensing inspections.  These inspections are documented on the LIC809 form.				
							
			RCFEs must post all LIC809s that have been issued within the preceding 12 months in a conspicuous place in the facility. %%FP###Fire Marshal Clearance###Prior to accepting any residents, the facility licensee must notify CCL, and obtain a fire clearance for the type of clients an RCFE plans to serve.   Fire Marshal requirements are different for an ambulatory resident than for a bedridden resident.   All RCFEs must maintain an approved fire clearance by the fire department or jurisdiction over the area where the facility is located. %%G###Healing Wounds###Title 22, Section 87101(h) defines healing wounds as those wounds which include cuts, stage 1 and 2 dermal ulcers [also known as decubitus ulcers, pressure sores, or bed sores], as diagnosed by a physician, and incisions that are being treated by an appropriate skilled professional with the affected area returning to its normal state. %%FP###Home Health Agency###A home health agency is an organization offering third party caregivers or skilled medical professionals for hire.  Not all home health agencies are certified Medicare providers.  If use of third party caregivers or skilled medical professionals is expected to be reimbursed through Medicare, it is important to select a Medicare-certified agency; otherwise services rendered by a non-Medicare certified agency will not be reimbursed by Medicare.   				
							
Third party caregivers or skilled medical professionals hired through a home health agency can be used in an RCFE.  These individuals must have criminal background checks, unless they are 'licensed or certified medical professionals' (Title 22, Section 87411). %%C&S###Hospice Care###The Hospice Foundation of America describes hospice as a ". . . special concept of care designed to provide comfort, pain relief and support to residents and their families when a life-limiting illness no longer responds to cure-oriented treatments.  This type of care neither prolongs life, nor hastens death, but rather has the goal to improved the quality of a resident's last days or months by offering comfort and dignity. (www.hospicefoundation.org).    Hospice care is sometimes referred to as palliative care. %%FP###Hospice Waiver###RCFEs can retain residents who require hospice services IF the facility has requested a Hospice Waiver under Title 22, Section 87633.  The License will state how many hospice residents the facility may retain at any one time.  Consumers are allowed to use any hospice agency they choose - families do not have to use the hospice agency an RCFE might recommend.  A written hospice care plan for each terminally ill resident will be developed by the hospice agency engaged by the family.  It is the facility's responsibility to ensure the plan is current, and accurately matches the services being provided, and that the resident's needs are being met at all times, not just when the hospice employees are with the resident.    The state's approval for a hospice waiver is generally a two to four page letter outlining the terms the hospice waiver is granted.  The hospice waiver is frequently posted near the facility license%%C&S###Incontinence###Under Title 22, Section 87625, facilities are permitted to accept or retain residents who have manageable bowel and/or bladder incontinence condition provide the condition can be managed with self care by the resident, a structured bowel/bladder retaining program that assists the resident in restoring a normal pattern of continence, a program of scheduled toileting at regular intervals, or the use of incontinent care products.    Privacy must always be afforded to a resident receiving bowel/bladder care.  Incontinence is an Allowable Health Condition.	%% FP###Insurance###Whether to carry liability is no longer left to the discretion of the licensee.  Effective 7/1/2015, the new law goes into effect; all RCFEs (assisted living facilities) in California will be required to carry liability insurance compliant with the Health and Safety Code 1569.618(c).

Because this is a new requirement, CARR recommends that consumers ask the licensee to produce proof of insurance, to have the assurance that the facility is compliant with the law, and has the coverage required:  $1,000,000 per occurrence, and $3,000,000 in the aggregate.  

If you find that a facility cannot produce proof of liability insurance with the required limits, you should file a complaint with California's Department of Social Services, Community Care Licensing.%%G###Licensee###The licensee is the individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association or county having the authority and responsibility for the operation of a licensed residential care facility for the elderly (Title 22, Section 87101(l). %%G###License###The License if the basic permit and state authorization to operate a residential care facility for the elderly%%G###Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) ###The licensing program analysts or LPAs are employees of Community Care Licensing (CCL) responsible for licensing, inspecting, and investigating RCFEs in California.  They are authorized to conduct inspections, site visits, issue citations and civil penalties%%M###Medication Management###RCFEs cannot directly administer medications to residents; medication administration is reserved for appropriately skilled professionals.  RCFEs are allowed to accept or retain residents who can administer their own medications, residents who need only be reminded or assisted to take medication, or residents receiving needed medical care from a visiting nurse.  (Title 22, Sections 87455 and 87465 provide additional detail on this subject.)				
							
							
%%M###Medications Centrally Stored###Title 22, Section 87465 stated the circumstances which require that residents' medications be centrally stored:				
			- Any medication determined by the physician to be hazardous if kept in the personal possession of the person for who the medication is prescribed.				
			- If the medication requires refrigeration and the resident does not have a private refrigerator.  Medications may  not be kept in the kitchen refrigerator.				
			- If the medication is a controlled substance such as morphine (DEA schedules 2 through 4). %%M###Medication Administration Training###For RCFE employees who assist with administration of medications to residents, the training requirements are contained in Health and Safety Code 1569.69 and in title 22, Section 87411:				
			- 16 or more residents - 8 hours of hands-on shadowing  and 8 hours of other training				
			- 15 or fewer residents - 2 hours of hands on shadowing and 4 hours of other training				
			- In all facilities, personnel assisting residents with self-administration of medications must complete 4 hours of training every 12 months.  				
Facilities having 16 or more residents are required to have a pharmacist or nurse review the medication management program and procedures at least twice a year.  Documentation of the review is mandated. %%M###Morphine###Morphine is prescribed to individuals having chronic or severe pain or to terminally-ill residents.  Most residents prescribed morphine typically are receiving hospice services.  Title 22, Section 87633 allows family members or friends to administer medications - including morphine to hospice residents who are unable to self-administer as long as				
			- it is written in the hospice care plan,				
			- family members have been trained by the hospice agency in proper administration				
			- it is recorded in the plan that if the family or friend is not available at the appointed time, that the RCFE will make available a licensed health professional to attended to the resident's needs and administer the medication.				
							
			Morphine pumps are permissible if the RCFE has a Hospice Waiver, if the resident or an appropriately skilled professional is administering the medication, and if the procedure is specified in the Hospice Care Plan. %% G###NonAmbulatory Person###A non-ambulatory person is one who is unable to leave a building unassisted under emergency conditions.  It includes, but is not limited to, those persons who depend upon mechanical aids such as crutches, walkers and wheelchairs.  It also includes persons who are unable, or likely to be unable to respond physically or mentally to a verbal instruction relating to fire danger and, unassisted, take appropriate action related to such danger (Title 22, Section 87101(n)(2).    NonAmbulatory persons include those who have dementia and who are bedridden.   Also see Ambulatory Person. %%C&S###Oxygen Administration (Gas and Liquid) ###A facility may accept or retain a resident who requires the use of oxygen GAS if the resident				
			- Is mentally and physically capable of operating the equipment, is able to determine her need for oxygen, and is able to administer it to herself,  OR				
			- Intermittent oxygen administration is performed by an appropriately skilled professional.  				
							
			The RCFE must post "No Smoking - Oxygen in Use" signs.  Oxygen tanks that are not portable must be secured in a stand or to a wall.  And plastic tubing from the face mask to the tank shall be long enough to allow movement of the resident but not constitute a hazard to residents or others.  				
							
			Use of LIQUID oxygen in an RCFE is allowed only wither approval from the licensing agency.   Use of oxygen in an RCFE is considered a Restricted Health Condition. %%FP###Payment Options for Assisted Living###Assisted living services in California are almost entirely private pay.

Postural supports used in an RCFE must not be used to restrain the individual, or  deprive or limit the use of a resident's hands or feet.  Title 22, Section 87608%%G###Power of Attorney###A Power of Attorney (POA) is a written authorization where one person appoints another person to act as an agent on his or her behalf.  POAs can be established to control finances of another, to make healthcare decisions, or can confer other authorities to the agent.  				
							
			A Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) is a different type of agency relationship in that it provides for one person to make decisions for another, in the event the person is unable to make decisions for herself - as in the case of incapacitation or dementia.  				
							
			It is important that an attorney be consulted if a POA or DPOA is being written.  The law varies from state to state, and some powers cannot be delegated to the POA. %%C&S###Pressure Sores###Pressure sores (also known as decubitus ulcers or bed sores) are medical conditions allowed to be treated in an RCFE.  Pressure sores are staged according to the depth of the wound.   Residents with Stage I and II pressure sores can be retained in an RCFE, and the resident must receive wound care from an appropriately skilled professional.  Stage I and II pressure sores are considered Allowable Health Conditions.  				
							
			Stage III and IV and Unstageable pressure sores must receive medical attention immediately to protect the health and safety of the resident.  These are prohibited health conditions for an RCFE unless the resident is on hospice. %%C&S###Prohibited Health Conditions###Under Title 22, Section 87615, if a person has one or more of the following health conditions, or if they require health services to accommodate these health conditions, they cannot be admitted or retained in an RCFE:

			- Staff infection or other serious infection				
			- Tracheostomies				
			Persons needing others to perform all activities of daily living, unless the facility has in place a Total Care Waiver. %%M###PRN Medication###An RCFE may dispense PRN (pro re nata) medications.    The PRN medication is any non-prescription or prescription medication which is to be taken 'as needed.'  This prescribing protocol (as needed) contrasts with other prescribing protocols such as 'every 12 hours,' or '3 times a day with meals.'  An example of a PRN is aspirin which can be taken 'as needed' for a headache%%G###POLST###POLST is an acronym for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST).  According to capolst.org, a POLST is ". . .  a form that gives seriously-ill patients more control over their end-of-life care, including medical treatment, extraordinary measures (such as a ventilator or feeding tube), and CPR.  It is printed on bright pink paper, and signed by both a doctor and patient.  The POLST can prevent unwanted or ineffective treatments, reduce patient and family suffering, and ensure that a patient's wishes are honored. "   A copy of the POLST should be given to the RCFE and retained in the resident's file, healthcare providers and emergency medical personnel should also have access to the POLST. For more information contact capolst.org at (916) 489-2222. %%SR###RCFE or Residential Care Facility for the Elderly###Title 22 defines a Residential Care Facility for the Elderly as a housing arrangement voluntarily chosen by the resident, the resident's guardian, conservator or other responsible person.  75% of the RCFE residents must be 60 years of age, or older, and where varying levels of care and supervision are provided, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal.				
							
		An RCFE is also called Assisted Living Facility.  And an RCFE is not the same as a Skilled Nursing Facility. %%SR###Refunds###Title 22 only mandates refunds in two situations:  				
			- Where the department orders the relocation of a resident.  If the state orders the relocation of a resident, the resident is relieved of any advance notice requirements contained in the admissions agreement.  				
			- Upon the death of a resident, the agreement between the facility and the resident is terminated and relatives are not liable for any payment beyond that due at the date of death, unless agreed to in writing or ordered by a court.  				
			- Consumers are reminded however, that the refund policy contained in the signed Admissions Agreement is binding. %%SR###Resident Rights###Residents in RCFEs do not give up their rights to live in assisted living.  Title 22 enumerates some, but not all rights of the resident.  At admission, a resident and the resident's responsible person must be personally advised of, and given a list of these rights.  They include the right to vote, the right to be accorded dignity in personal relationships with staff, residents and other persons.  To be accorded safe, healthful and comfortable accommodations; to be free from corporal or unusual punishment; to be informed by the licensee about how to file a complaint; freedom to attend religious services; to depart the facility at any time and to not be locked into any room; to visit the facility prior to move-in; to wear his own clothes; to have access to individual storage for private use, to have reasonable access to telephones, to send and receive unopened correspondence, to receive or reject medical care among others.  Also - the resident many not be deprived of any civil or legal right, benefit or privilege guaranteed by law, by the California constitution or by the Constitution of the United States.				
							
			If a resident's rights are violated, the circumstance should be reported to your local state licensing office so a complaint can be filed. %%G###Responsible Party###The 'responsible party' is the person, including a relative, health care surrogate decision maker or placement agency, who assists the resident in placement, or who assumes varying degrees of responsibility for the resident's well-being. %%SR###Restraints###A restraint is an action of keeping someone or something under control.  In an RCFE a resident is to be free from corporal or unusual punishment, and is to be able to come and go from the facility at any time, and may not be locked into any room, building or facility premises at any time.  If the resident is restrained, it is a violation of the resident's personal rights.  (Title 22, Section 87572).				
							
			Many things in an assisted living facility can be used to restrict the movement, motion and activity of residents including postural supports, bed  rails, geri-chairs, sliding trays, locks on doors, wooden bars in sliding doors or use of psychotropic and sedating drugs.  In each case, restricting a resident's right to free and unfettered movement is a serious Resident Rights violation.%%C&S###Restricted Health Conditions###Under Title 22, Section 87612, the following conditions are listed as Restricted Health Conditions.  In each condition, the RCFE must comply with the additional requirements associated with it in order for the facility to be able to provide that specific type of care.
